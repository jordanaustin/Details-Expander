Details-Expander
================

A details element polyfill with minimal CSS and JavaScript.
This is based on the purposed spec by the W3C. Easy read: http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/details.html and a wiki here http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/details

If you'd like to use the details element and don't know where to start, take a look at html5doctor's little tutorial: http://html5doctor.com/the-details-and-summary-elements/ 

<h2>Dependancies</h2>
Currently dependant on Modernizr for detecting if the details element is supported.
